This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in distutils-based
python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious and error-prone "update
the embedded version string" step from your release process. Making a new
release should be as easy as recording a new tag in your version-control
system, and maybe making new tarballs.


## Quick Install

* `pip install versioneer` to somewhere to your $PATH
* run `versioneer-installer` in your source tree: this installs `versioneer.py`
* follow the instructions below (also in the `versioneer.py` docstring)

## Version Identifiers

Source trees come from a variety of places:

* a version-control system checkout (mostly used by developers)
* a nightly tarball, produced by build automation
* a snapshot tarball, produced by a web-based VCS browser, like github's
  "tarball from tag" feature
* a release tarball, produced by "setup.py sdist", distributed through PyPI

Within each source tree, the version identifier (either a string or a number,
this tool is format-agnostic) can come from a variety of places:

* ask the VCS tool itself, e.g. "git describe" (for checkouts), which knows
  about recent "tags" and an absolute revision-id
* the name of the directory into which the tarball was unpacked
* an expanded VCS variable ($Id$, etc)
* a `_version.py` created by some earlier build step

For released software, the version identifier is closely related to a VCS
tag. Some projects use tag names that include more than just the version
string (e.g. "myproject-1.2" instead of just "1.2"), in which case the tool
needs to strip the tag prefix to extract the version identifier. For
unreleased software (between tags), the version identifier should provide
enough information to help developers recreate the same tree, while also
giving them an idea of roughly how old the tree is (after version 1.2, before
version 1.3). Many VCS systems can report a description that captures this,
for example 'git describe --tags --dirty --always' reports things like
"0.7-1-g574ab98-dirty" to indicate that the checkout is one revision past the
0.7 tag, has a unique revision id of "574ab98", and is "dirty" (it has
uncommitted changes.

The version identifier is used for multiple purposes:

* to allow the module to self-identify its version: `myproject.__version__`
* to choose a name and prefix for a 'setup.py sdist' tarball

## Theory of Operation

Versioneer works by adding a special `_version.py` file into your source
tree, where your `__init__.py` can import it. This `_version.py` knows how to
dynamically ask the VCS tool for version information at import time. However,
when you use "setup.py build" or "setup.py sdist", `_version.py` in the new
copy is replaced by a small static file that contains just the generated
version data.

`_version.py` also contains `$Revision$` markers, and the installation
process marks `_version.py` to have this marker rewritten with a tag name
during the "git archive" command. As a result, generated tarballs will
contain enough information to get the proper version.


## Installation

First, decide on values for the following configuration variables:

* `versionfile_source`:

  A project-relative pathname into which the generated version strings should
  be written. This is usually a `_version.py` next to your project's main
  `__init__.py` file. If your project uses `src/myproject/__init__.py`, this
  should be `src/myproject/_version.py`. This file should be checked in to
  your VCS as usual: the copy created below by 'setup.py update_files' will
  include code that parses expanded VCS keywords in generated tarballs. The
  'build' and 'sdist' commands will replace it with a copy that has just the
  calculated version string.

*  `versionfile_build`:

  Like `versionfile_source`, but relative to the build directory instead of
  the source directory. These will differ when your setup.py uses
  'package_dir='. If you have `package_dir={'myproject': 'src/myproject'}`,
  then you will probably have `versionfile_build='myproject/_version.py'` and
  `versionfile_source='src/myproject/_version.py'`.

* `tag_prefix`:

  a string, like 'PROJECTNAME-', which appears at the start of all VCS tags.
  If your tags look like 'myproject-1.2.0', then you should use
  tag_prefix='myproject-'. If you use unprefixed tags like '1.2.0', this
  should be an empty string.

* `parentdir_prefix`:

  a string, frequently the same as tag_prefix, which appears at the start of
  all unpacked tarball filenames. If your tarball unpacks into
  'myproject-1.2.0', this should be 'myproject-'.

This tool provides one script, named `versioneer-installer`. That script does
one thing: write a copy of `versioneer.py` into the current directory.

To versioneer-enable your project:

* 1: Run `versioneer-installer` to copy `versioneer.py` into the top of your
  source tree.

* 2: add the following lines to the top of your `setup.py`, with the
  configuration values you decided earlier:

        import versioneer
        versioneer.versionfile_source = 'src/myproject/_version.py'
        versioneer.versionfile_build = 'myproject/_version.py'
        versioneer.tag_prefix = '' # tags are like 1.2.0
        versioneer.parentdir_prefix = 'myproject-' # dirname like 'myproject-1.2.0'

* 3: add the following arguments to the setup() call in your setup.py:

        version=versioneer.get_version(),
        cmdclass=versioneer.get_cmdclass(),

* 4: now run `setup.py update_files`, which will create `_version.py`, and
  will modify your `__init__.py` to define `__version__` (by calling a
  function from `_version.py`). It will also modify your `MANIFEST.in` to
  include both `versioneer.py` and the generated `_version.py` in sdist
  tarballs.

* 5: commit these changes to your VCS. To make sure you won't forget,
  `update_files` will mark everything it touched for addition.

## Post-Installation Usage

Once established, all uses of your tree from a VCS checkout should get the
current version string. All generated tarballs should include an embedded
version string (so users who unpack them will not need a VCS tool installed).

If you distribute your project through PyPI, then the release process should
boil down to two steps:

* 1: git tag 1.0
* 2: python setup.py register sdist upload

If you distribute it through github (i.e. users use github to generate
tarballs with `git archive`), the process is:

* 1: git tag 1.0
* 2: git push; git push --tags

Currently, all version strings must be based upon a tag. Versioneer will
report "unknown" until your tree has at least one tag in its history. This
restriction will be fixed eventually (see issue #12).

## Version-String Flavors

Code which uses Versioneer can learn about its version string at runtime by
importing `_version` from your main `__init__.py` file and running the
`get_versions()` function. From the "outside" (e.g. in `setup.py`), you can
import the top-level `versioneer.py` and run `get_versions()`.

Both functions return a dictionary with different keys for different flavors
of the version string:

* `['version']`: condensed tag+distance+shortid+dirty identifier. For git,
  this uses the output of `git describe --tags --dirty --always` but strips
  the tag_prefix. For example "0.11-2-g1076c97-dirty" indicates that the tree
  is like the "1076c97" commit but has uncommitted changes ("-dirty"), and
  that this commit is two revisions ("-2-") beyond the "0.11" tag. For
  released software (exactly equal to a known tag), the identifier will only
  contain the stripped tag, e.g. "0.11".

* `['full']`: detailed revision identifier. For Git, this is the full SHA1
  commit id, followed by "-dirty" if the tree contains uncommitted changes,
  e.g. "1076c978a8d3cfc70f408fe5974aa6c092c949ac-dirty".

Some variants are more useful than others. Including `full` in a bug report
should allow developers to reconstruct the exact code being tested (or
indicate the presence of local changes that should be shared with the
developers). `version` is suitable for display in an "about" box or a CLI
`--version` output: it can be easily compared against release notes and lists
of bugs fixed in various releases.

In the future, this will also include a
[PEP-0440](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) -compatible flavor
(e.g. `1.2.post0.dev123`). This loses a lot of information (and has no room
for a hash-based revision id), but is safe to use in a `setup.py`
"`version=`" argument. It also enables tools like *pip* to compare version
strings and evaluate compatibility constraint declarations.

The `setup.py update_files` command adds the following text to your
`__init__.py` to place a basic version in `YOURPROJECT.__version__`:

    from ._version import get_versions
    __version = get_versions()['version']
    del get_versions

## Future Directions

This tool is designed to make it easily extended to other version-control
systems: all VCS-specific components are in separate directories like
src/git/ . The top-level `versioneer.py` script is assembled from these
components by running make-versioneer.py . In the future, make-versioneer.py
will take a VCS name as an argument, and will construct a version of
`versioneer.py` that is specific to the given VCS. It might also take the
configuration arguments that are currently provided manually during
installation by editing setup.py . Alternatively, it might go the other
direction and include code from all supported VCS systems, reducing the
number of intermediate scripts.
